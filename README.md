# Computer Hardware & Software

I'm going to teach you how to build the ultimate PC setup! I learned these skills when I was a computer technician intern at Earl C Clements Job Corps, and during my internship I became very familiar with different computer hardware and how to troubleshoot/repair these intricate components. Building a PC is one of the most fun and engaging projects a person can do to gain experience when trying to break into the IT field. I will NOT be telling you which types of hardware to get because that is part of the fun! Building a PC puts you in an exclusive club of tech geeks but building a PC setup with parts that YOU like makes it a unique experience. 

These are the hardware that you will need to complete this build:
Case,
Motherboard,
CPU,
RAM,
SSD or Hard Drive,
PSU,
CPU Heat Sink,
CPU Fan (if not integrated with the heat sink),
Video Card (GPU),
Sound Card (if not integrated into the motherboard),
2 Monitors,
Keyboard,
Mouse,
Cables (SATA, Power cables, etc.),
Speakers.
